# codicon-Los_esoTillin
jesucristo en ti conf√≠o
This was a project made for the lexpin's event codicon, where I worked with 3 friends, Arantza (she made the majority jpg and png), Sebastian Valdez with was in lexpin's course but not at the same stage as me,
and Mauricio Chacin wich didn't know almost anything about coding at the time he joined the project.
In the end I learned a lot about having good pratices while working in group to have efficients results.
